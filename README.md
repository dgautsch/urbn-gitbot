# URBN GitBot

## Documentation
* [Botkit Documentation](./BotKit.md)

## Running Locally

In order to run the bot locally, you need to provide a bot name. When the bot name is set a subdomain will be created for you on the localtunnel service. This exposed url will need to be added to the App Configuration within Slack.

* `GITBOT_NAME=botname npm run dev`
